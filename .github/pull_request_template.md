## Merge Checklist

The following items should be done before any PR can be approved and merged. A PR should be:

- [ ] Descriptive. Describe the PR problem, solution, and attach a ticket/card. The problem should be in your own words, not copy/pasted. Explain why you took this approach, and what alternatives you considered.
- [ ] Fully unit tested. There is spec coverage for all new code, and spec coverage for modified code, within reason.
- [ ] Secure & Private. The changes are secure by default and do not expose/leak any sensitive information to unauthorized requests, both logged in and logged out, and there is spec coverage confirming that.
- [ ] Performant. All possible steps have been taken to ensure that the code written is as efficient as possible and will not introduce performance regressions for the code being added/changed or the website as a whole.
- [ ] Small. A product PR should be less than a few hundred lines to be reasonably reviewable within a couple days. Don't submit big PRs for review on tight deadlines. Split big PRs into smaller PRs or contact lead engineers for guidance.
